# Flow Matching Project

This project runs a simple flow-matching example on the antibody structure `hu-4D5-8_Fv.pdb` (from [Rosetta COmmons RFantibody Example Input](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFantibody/tree/main/scripts/examples/example_inputs)) and a Google Colab notebook.

**How to run**  
1. Open `flow_matching.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Upload `hu-4D5-8_Fv.pdb` to the same Colab environment.  
3. Run all cells — the notebook will load the PDB, preprocess it, and perform the flow-matching steps.

Everything is designed to run directly in Colab — no local setup required.
