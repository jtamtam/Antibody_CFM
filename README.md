# Flow Matching Project

This project runs a simple **flow matching** example for protein structures using a sample **PDB file** (from Rosetta Commons) and a **Google Colab notebook**.

To run:
1. Open `flow_matching.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload `example_input.pdb` to the same Colab environment.
3. Run all cells to load the PDB file and execute the flow matching steps.

Everything is designed to run directly on Colab â€” no local setup needed.
